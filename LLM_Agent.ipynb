You also possess strong reasoning abilities, allowing you to deduce the answer to your query using existing knowledge and information. You need to utilize your knowledge and reasoning skills to play a game of 20 questions. In each round of the game, choose the binary attribute most likely to aid your deduction, such as \"a cross on the flag.\" Using this attribute, ask a question in English. Generally, the most helpful attribute provides the maximum information gain, meaning it significantly reduces the entropy of your guess, regardless of whether the answer is **yes** or **no**. For example, if you believe asking about the color is most helpful for your deduction, you should ask, \"Is it a thing with a red color?\" And after your thorough thinking, you need to denote the key binary attribute with double stars<end_of_turn>\n",

This division can effectively narrow down the options. 2. Population and Area: Considering population and area can also eliminate some countries. 3. Other Colors on the Flag: We know the flag has red; we can further narrow down by asking about other colors. 4. Language: European countries have various languages; asking about the official language can narrow it further. Reasoning: Southern Europe includes a few countries such as Spain, Italy, Portugal, Greece, etc. Determining if it is in Southern Europe can immediately eliminate about three-quarters of European countries. Compared to questions about flag colors or language, geographical location questions are more evenly distributed, and a **yes** or **no** answer will significantly narrow down the range. Possible Next Steps: If the answer is **yes**, we can further inquire about other notable characteristics of these countries, such as language or history. If the answer is **no**, we can turn our attention to Western, Eastern, or Northern Europe and continue narrowing down the options.**Question:** \"Is this country in Southern Europe?\"<end_of_turn>\n",

Type of Entity: Determining whether it is a city or a landmark can greatly narrow down our options. 2. Geographical Location: If we can determine the continent, we can significantly reduce the number of possible cities or landmarks. 3. Cultural/Historical Significance: Asking about cultural or historical significance can also be helpful, but it might be too broad at this stage. Reasoning: To effectively narrow it down, the most efficient next step is to determine if it is a city or a landmark. By determining if it is a city, we can immediately focus on known cities globally, which are fewer and more well-documented compared to all possible landmarks. If it is not a city, we can then focus on landmarks, which might require more specific questions but will also significantly narrow our scope. Possible Next Steps: If the answer is **yes**, we can then ask about the continent or specific features of the city.

Now we know it must be a landmark. Given this, our goal is to identify the type or location of the landmark. 1. Type of Landmark: There are various types such as natural landmarks (mountains, rivers), man-made landmarks (statues, buildings), or historical sites. 2. Geographical Location: Identifying the continent or region can greatly narrow down the possibilities. To get a high information gain, let us narrow down the type of landmark first. Reasoning: Landmarks can be broadly categorized into man-made or natural. This binary distinction will help us immediately focus on a more specific set of possibilities. Man-made landmarks include famous buildings, statues, monuments, etc., while natural landmarks include mountains, rivers, and natural formations. Possible Next Steps: If the answer is **yes**, we can then ask about the purpose or era of the man-made structure. If the answer is **no**, we can focus on identifying the type of natural landmark or its location. **Question:** \"Is it a man-made landmark?\"<end_of_turn>\n",

Type of Natural Landmark: Common natural landmarks include mountains, rivers, lakes, forests, deserts, etc. 2. Geographical Location: Identifying the continent or region can still be very helpful. To further narrow down, let us focus on the type of natural landmark. Reasoning: River are one of the most well-known types of natural landmarks. Possible Next Steps: If the answer is **yes**, we can then focus on identifying which river by asking about its specific features or location. If the answer is **no**, we can eliminate a significant category and focus on other types of natural landmarks like mountains, lakes, deserts, or forests. **Question:** \"Is it a river?\"<end_of_turn>\n",

Now, we need to narrow down which river it could be. To do this effectively, identifying the continent or region will significantly help. 1. Geographical Location: Identifying the continent or region can narrow down the list of possible rivers considerably. 2. Length or Size: Asking about whether it is among the longest rivers might also help. 3. Famous Rivers: There are some rivers that are globally well-known due to their significance. To achieve a high information gain, let us focus on the geographical location. Reasoning: Asia has some of the world us most significant and longest rivers, such as the Yangtze, Ganges, and Mekong. Possible Next Steps: If the answer is **yes**, we can focus on Asian rivers specifically. If the answer is **no**, we can eliminate Asia and consider other continents like Africa, Europe, South America, or North America. **Question:** \"Is this reiver located in Asia?\"<end_of_turn>\n",

This narrows down our options significantly. Now, we need to focus on identifying which river it could be. Considerations: 1. Famous Asian Rivers: Asia has several famous rivers, such as the Yangtze, Ganges, Mekong, Indus, and Yellow River. 2. Geographical Features: We could ask about the river's length, the countries it flows through, or any significant historical or cultural associations. 3. To narrow it down further, let us focus on whether it is one of the most well-known rivers. Reasoning: These three rivers are among the longest and most significant in Asia. Possible Next Steps: If the answer is **yes**, we can focus on distinguishing between these three. If the answer is **no**, we can focus on other significant rivers like the Ganges, Indus, or Brahmaputra. **Question:** \"Is this river one of the three longest rivers in Asia (Yangtze, Yellow, or Mekong)?\"<end_of_turn>\n",

Let us narrow it down further by focusing on specific characteristics of these rivers. Considerations: 1. Geographical Location: We can ask about the countries the river flows through. 2. Cultural/Historical Significance: Each of these rivers has distinct cultural and historical significance. To narrow it down further, let us ask about the country. Reasoning: Both the Yangtze and Yellow rivers flow through China, while the Mekong flows through several countries including China, but predominantly in Southeast Asia. Possible Next Steps: If the answer is yes, it will most likely be the Yangtze or Yellow River. If the answer is no, it must be the Mekong River. **Question:** \"Does this river flow through China?\"<end_of_turn>\n",

This means it is either the Yangtze River or the Yellow River. To determine which one it is, we should focus on distinguishing features. Considerations: 1. Length: The Yangtze is the longest river in Asia and the third-longest in the world. 2. Color/Name: The Yellow River is named for its yellowish color due to loess sediments. Reasoning: The Yangtze River is the longest river in Asia. Possible Next Steps: If the answer is **yes**, it is the Yangtze River.
